# robot_challenge

Helping a stupid robot move left or right is a challenge. Clone this repository to test your sanity. I am assuming that you are running Node JS and have `npm` installed.

Clone command: `git clone https://github.com/andrewstec/robot_challenge`

Next, install the node_module libraries to support the source code of this repository.

Install libraries command: `npm install`

Build the TypeScript source code into JavaScript: `npm run build`.

Finally, start the server by running the built JavaScript files with `npm run start`.
